# What I learned
 The DRY principle drives really good, questions of "how do I...". After creating the method for populating the array list with each aircraft other methods required the data it produced. After invoking the array list populating method for the second time, I searched for a way to not repeat myself which led to invoking the method main to ensure the aircraft list was only populated once and be accessible by all the dependent methods.
